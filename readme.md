# Capstone 1: E-commerce

Application Development: Front=end Path Project 1

## Description

In this project, I showcase my newly learned skills of HTML, CSS & JS by creating a E-commerce website. I utilized Bootstrap and JS for responsive, flex and styling tools. I have made 5 pages consisting of my home page, registration, sign-up, products and check-out page. For my work, I have started building out the framework using Visual Studio Code, developing a theme and then building my code around that theme for a fully-functioning display website. I have honed my fresh skills, in addition with Bootstrap and CSS to fully build out the 5 pages that is typically seen on a E-commerce site. 

## Description

One thing I am proud about on my page is my checkout page. I liked how my checkout form margin and checkout carts are aligned next to each other for a cleaner look. Also, on the check-out cart, I have added an addition of a small image displayed of each item ordered. This gives the customer a visual of what they ordered in their cart.
